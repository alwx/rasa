Improved exception handling within Rasa Open Source.

All exceptions that are somewhat expected (e.g. errors in file formats like 
configurations or training data) will share a common base class 
`RasaException`.

::warning Backwards Incompatibility
Base class for the exception raised when an action can not be found has been changed
from a `NameError` to a `ValueError`.
::

Some other exceptions have also slightly changed:
- raise `YamlSyntaxException` instead of YAMLError (from ruamel) when 
  failing to load a yaml file with information about the line where loading failed
- introduced `MissingDependencyException` as an exception raised if packages 
  need to be installed
